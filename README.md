 ### Business Understanding
 The goal of this analysis project was likely to gain insights into the retail company's performance and identify areas for improvement. By analyzing data on sales, profit, and other metrics across different dimensions, the company can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, product popularity, and regional trends.
 
 This information can be used to make data-driven decisions about:
- Inventory management: The company can use the data to identify which products are selling well and which are not, and adjust their inventory levels accordingly.
- Pricing: The data can be used to optimize pricing strategies for different products and regions.
- Marketing and promotions: The company can use the data to target marketing and promotional campaigns to the most profitable customer segments.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
 EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

Here are some of the key takeaways from the dashboard: 
		
- Overall, profits appear to be up 70% compared to the previous year.
- The top five states for profit are California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois.
- The top five sub-categories for profit are Office Supplies, Furniture, Computers, Breakroom, and Printers.
- Profit seems to be highest in the first quarter of each year.The following are some of the key takeaways from the dashboard:
- The total sum of sales for the period was $2,297,200.86.
- The state of California had the highest sum of sales, with $678,781.24.
- The sub-category of "Appliances" had the highest sum of profit, with $203,412.73.
- The year 2016 had the highest sum of sales, with $725,457.82.
		
The dashboard also includes a number of filters that allow users to drill down into the data and see more detailed information.

### Recommendations for stakeholders
- Focus on the sub-categories that are the most profitable. The dashboard shows that the "Benders" sub-category is the most profitable, followed by "Machines" and "Chairs." Stakeholders should focus on these sub-categories when making decisions about product development, marketing, and sales.
- Increase sales in the South region. The dashboard shows that the South region is the least profitable. Stakeholders should take steps to increase sales in this region, such as opening new stores or running targeted marketing campaigns.
- Improve profitability in the years 2014 and 2015. The dashboard shows that the company's profitability declined in 2014 and 2015. Stakeholders should investigate the reasons for this decline and take steps to improve profitability in the future.
		 
### Challenges
Some potential challenges faced while creating this dashboard includes:

- Data quality:- Retail data was dirty and inconsistent, making accurate results difficult.
- Data accuracy:- Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data was crucial for reliable analysis.
- Data Visualization:- Choosing the right charts and graphs to effectively represent complex data and avoid overwhelming the user can be difficult.
- Performance:- If the dashboard is used to track data across a large number of stores or products, ensuring it performs well and updates quickly can be a challenge.
- Communicating insights:- Once insights have been gained, it is important to communicate them to stakeholders in a way that is easy to understand and actionable.

### Future enhancements
- Track the number of customers who visit the store each day.
- Track the average amount of money each customer spends.
- Track the most popular products purchased each day.
- Track the most popular times of day for shopping.
- Track the demographics of customers who shop at the store.
  By tracking these metrics, the retailer can gain a better understanding of its customers and their shopping habits. This information can then be used to improve the retailer's marketing efforts, product selection, and customer service.


### Additional future Analysis
- It would be interesting to compare the company's profits to the profits of its competitors. This would help to identify areas where the company is doing well and areas where it could improve.
- It would also be interesting to analyze the relationship between the company's profits and other factors, such as the economy, the price of gas, and the unemployment rate. This would help to identify the factors that are driving the company's profits.
